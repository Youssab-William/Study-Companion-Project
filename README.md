# Study-Companion-Project
Make sure to install the following libraries:
<M5Core2.h>, <SPIFFS.h>, <cmath>, <EEPROM.h>

User manual; 

Uploading the code
1. Open the .ino file into Arduino IDE. Under "Tools", install (if not yet installed), then go to Board>M5Stack>M5Stack-Core2
2. Connect your M5Stack-Core2 to a USB port
3. Select your port
4. Upload the code 

Using the device
1. If you are a new user, press the leftmost button and follow the instructions on-screen
2. You can then sit down and focus on your work for 30 minutes
3. If you need to take a pause, shake the device. A 5-minute pause will be initiated
4. After 30 minutes, shake the device and choose to stretch or study
5. For stretching, follow the instructions on-screen, For study, go back to step 2 of "Using the device" section

The stress function is apart. To play around with it, upload the code attached (Follow Upload the code section) and follow the model used in the attached report.


Challenges:
The main and only challenge worthy of noting that we encountered was integration.
Upon designing and coding all the functions separately, we could have done a better job at keeping track of which function fits where inside
each of our teammates' functions. As it turns out, metaphorically speaking, there is a limit beyond which "Divide to conquer" becomes a double-edged sword.

If we had to start this project over, we would arrange simultaneous coding sessions during which each of us can ask questions to better understand the
integration of their code in the others'. Otherwise, we were very satisfied with the end result.
